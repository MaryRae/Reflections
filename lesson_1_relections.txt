What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

If you manually choose when to commit, your commits will makes more sense.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because it's a pain to track down when multiple inter-related files were sync-ed up!.

I'd like to try using Git for my JMP files and for my Python scripts for Dave!
